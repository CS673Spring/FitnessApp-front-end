                    Olympic Weightlifting or weightlifting for short utilizes a few complex movements in which lifters move a barbell loaded with weight from the ground to overhead position. The general movements include the snatch, clean, jerk, and press. Unlike powerlifting or bodybuilding, weightlifting has an emphasis on human ballistic limits(explosive strength). Movements in weightlifting are typically executed faster, requiring greater mobility and flexibility.
