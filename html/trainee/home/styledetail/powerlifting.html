                    Powerlifting is a strength sport consisting of three different lifts utilizing a barbell. They include squat, bench press, and deadlift. Powerlifting is focused on maximal weight for each of the movements and working to learn and excel in every aspect of each lift. Powerlifting, unlike bodybuilding, does not emphasize the pursuit of a specified physique, rather to attain as much power as possible.
